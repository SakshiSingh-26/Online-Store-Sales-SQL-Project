📊 Key Insights
Laptops and smartphones dominated overall sales, making them the top revenue drivers. Despite having more orders, the apparel category generated far less revenue than electronics, indicating lower average order values and less profitability.
Among customers, C001 emerged as the highest spender with a strong average order value, while C002 showed loyalty with frequent purchases. However, some customers like C004 contributed very little, pointing toward opportunities for upselling or better targeting.
February 2024 recorded the highest monthly sales, likely due to seasonality or marketing efforts, while April marked a sharp decline, highlighting the need for consistent engagement strategies. Only laptops and smartphones crossed the ₹5,000 revenue mark, reinforcing their importance in driving business growth.
To sustain and grow revenue, the focus should be on scaling electronics sales, improving apparel performance through marketing or pricing strategies, and nurturing high-value and frequent-buying customers.
